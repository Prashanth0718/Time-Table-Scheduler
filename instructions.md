To run the code, follow these steps: 

1. Ensure that you have the following files in the same directory: 

   - `tts.py` 

   - `G43.py` 

   - `initialise.py` 

   - `Sections.txt` (containing section names and courses) 

   - `Faculty.txt` (containing faculty names and course preferences) 

   - `Course.txt` (containing course names and the number of slots required) 

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files. 

3. Run the `G43.py` file using the following command: 

   ``` 
   python G43.py 
   ``` 

4. The program will generate two timetable schedules, and the output will be printed to the console. 

5. Additionally, the program will create two output files: 

   - `SectionTT.txt`: This file contains the timetable schedule for each section, with faculties and courses. 

   - `FacultyTT.txt`: This file contains the timetable schedule for each faculty, with sections and courses. 

6. You can open these output files to view the generated timetables.
